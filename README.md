# Smart-Robot-Path-Planning

This proposed algorithm will use the range of Laser Scan completely without increasing  the local planner range instead by writing a wrapper class to the global planner will reduce computational complexity by saving time and distance travelled to reach a goal if an object obstructs the existing global path of  the robot.
